# üèóÔ∏è Build Output

This folder contains the final, compiled website files ready for deployment.

## What's in here:
- **index.html** - Final HTML file for the website
- **assets/** - Compressed and optimized JavaScript, CSS, and image files
- **Other static files** - Robots.txt, sitemap, favicon, etc.

## Purpose:
When you run `npm run build`, all the source code gets compiled, optimized, and output here. These are the files that actually get uploaded to the web server.

## Important Notes:
- This folder is automatically generated - don't edit files here manually
- Contents get overwritten every time you build
- This is what visitors actually download when they visit your website
- Files here are optimized for fast loading

## Who needs this:
- People deploying the website to servers
- Developers testing the final build before deployment
- Anyone checking file sizes and optimization

## Workflow:
1. Edit source code in `website-source-code/`
2. Run `npm run build` to generate these files
3. Upload these files to your web server
4. Visitors see the website from these optimized files
