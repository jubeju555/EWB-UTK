# 🎉 EWB-UTK Website - Organized File Structure Complete!

## ✅ What Was Reorganized

### **Before** (Messy)
```
📂 Everything mixed together in root:
- config files scattered
- docs mixed with code  
- scripts in root
- unclear file purposes
```

### **After** (Professional & Organized)
```
📁 config/           ⚙️ All configuration files
📁 docs/             📚 Complete documentation
📁 scripts/          🚀 Deployment & setup automation  
📁 src/              💻 Clean React source code
📁 public/           🌐 Static assets
📁 assets-legacy/    📦 Original files (archived)
```
