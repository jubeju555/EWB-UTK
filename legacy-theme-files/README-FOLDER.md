# üèõÔ∏è Legacy Theme Files

This folder contains the original website theme files and assets from before the React redesign.

## What's in here:
- **library/** - Original CSS, JavaScript, and image files
- **Old theme components** - Previous website styling and layout
- **Legacy assets** - Images and icons from the old design

## Purpose:
These files are preserved for:
- Reference when recreating old design elements
- Backup in case we need to revert to the previous website
- Understanding the original website structure
- Extracting assets that might be reused

## Important:
- These files are NOT used by the current website
- They're kept purely for reference and backup
- The current website is built with modern React technology
- Don't modify these files unless you're doing historical research

## Who might need this:
- Developers comparing old vs new implementations
- Designers referencing previous styling decisions
- Anyone researching the website's design evolution
- People who need to temporarily revert to the old website
